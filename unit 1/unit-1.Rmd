# R Software
It's a language

```{r}
print("its r")
```

we got examples

you can calculate numbers

```{r}
2+3

5-1

2*3

5^2

5/2

sqrt(10)

log(10)

exp(1)

sin(1)

cos(1)

tan(1)
```

Yeah okay that's cool but check this out

```{r}
y = 10

x = 15

x + y
```
yeah okay hello world

```{r}
print("hi")
```
vectors exist now

```{r}
x = c(1,2,3,4,5)

x

mean(x)
sd(x)
median(x)
IQR(x)
quantile(x, 0.5)
```
simulators?? generate that data

```{r}
x = rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
hist(x, breaks=50)
```

note that indexing starts at 1 : (
